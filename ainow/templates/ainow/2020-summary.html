        <p class="lead">Returning for a sixth year, TICTeC 2020 will focus on the impact that civic technology and digital democracy are having upon citizens, decision makers and governments around the world. </p>

        <p>Primarily, the goal of TICTeC is to promote and share rigorous and meaningful research into online civic technologies and digital democracy around the world. The conference facilitates discussion and networking amongst individuals and groups to find real-world solutions through sharing evidence of impact, and (importantly) evidence of what doesn’t work. </p>

        <p>TICTeC 2020 will bring together <a href="http://tictec.mysociety.org/sponsorship#attendees">individuals</a> from academic and applied backgrounds as well as businesses, public authorities, NGOs, funders and education institutions to discuss ideas, present research and build a network of individuals interested in the civic technology landscape. <a href="http://tictec.mysociety.org/sponsorship#attendees">See who’s previously attended TICTeC</a>.</p>

        <p>We invite individuals to submit abstracts or workshop / presentation proposals of no more than 300 words by <strong>17th January 2020</strong>.</p>

        <p>We encourage submissions to focus on the specific impacts of technologies, rather than showcase new tools that are as yet untested.</p>

        <h3>Guaranteed speaking slots</h3>
        <p>Are you really keen to present at TICTeC 2020 and interested in a guaranteed speaking slot? This year we are offering a limited number of guaranteed 20 minute speaking slots for a fee of $6000. This means you won’t need to compete against the hundreds of other submissions we receive through the open Call for Proposals. <a href="mailto:tictec@mysociety.org">Email us to discuss this option</a>.</p>
        <p>The fee for guaranteed speaking slots will go towards travel grants for attendees and speakers from the Global South who would not be able to attend TICTeC without financial support. TICTeC is a non-profit conference; the small amount of sponsorship we receive, and the income from ticket and speaking slot sales, is used to host the conference and enable us to provide travel support to attendees from the Global South.</p>
