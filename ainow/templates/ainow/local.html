        <p>TICTeC, now in its fifth successful year, is recognised globally as the most important conference for the understanding of Civic Technology.</p>
        <p>Now <strong>TICTeC Local</strong> brings the same winning formula to the municipal level.</p>
        <p>Join us as practitioners from the UK and beyond examine how digital tools can be deployed to improve civic participation, streamline citizen interaction with public bodies, enable citizen monitoring of public institutions, and create efficiencies in civic budgets.</p>

    <h2>What is Civic Tech?</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>The field of Civic Tech is growing across the globe, often at a grassroots level — and yet, to those outside its network, the term can be unfamiliar. You will often see ‘Civic Tech’ mentioned along with sister buzzwords like ‘smart cities’, ‘e-gov’, ‘govtech’, ‘ICT4D’ and ‘Tech For Good’, to name but a few. </p>
        <p>Civic Tech embraces all digital tools that enable citizens to easily and effectively engage with civic life, whether that is reporting an issue to a local authority, engaging with elected representatives or monitoring the use of community assets.</p>
        <p>At its most effective, Civic Tech can save lives, protect environments, and mobilise citizen task forces in times of crisis. At a useful if less dramatic level, it can save time and money for governments, improve neighbourhoods and keep residents informed.</p>
        <p>Civic Tech is often — but not exclusively — built by non-profit organisations working for a better, more representative, democratic or functional society. The result is often open source ‘tech for good’ software that is free or cheap to implement.</p>

      <h2>What will I get from TICTeC Local?</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8">
          <p><strong>You will not get</strong> sales pitches, technical talk that only experts could understand, or high-concept presentations with no relevance to your own daily work.</p>
          <p>TICTeC Local aims to build a bridge between the people that make digital tools for the public good, the people that use them and the people that examine their impact.</p>
          <p>We believe that too often digital tools are built in isolation from the organisations that buy them, and the citizens that use them, and because of this everyone’s experience is the poorer.</p>
          <p>At TICTeC Local, we’ll change that and bring down some of those barriers to discuss what <em>really</em> works. You will leave inspired by some of our showcased projects, you’ll have a better understanding of the most effective digital tools, and you’ll have met interesting people who are on a similar journey, or who might be able to help you in developing your digital capacity in the future.</p>
